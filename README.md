# pinecone-cli
Pinecode-cli is a command-line interface for control and data plane interfacing with [Pinecone](https://pinecone.io). 

In addition to ALL of the Pinecone "actions/verbs", Pinecone-cli has several additional features that make Pinecone even more powerful including:
   * Upload vectors from CSV files
   * Upload embeddings of text from a given website URL.  Embeddings generated by OpenAI embeddings API.
   * New "head" command to peak into a given index, similar to "head" in linux/unix.
 
# Usage
First off, let's simplify usage by setting the PINECONE_API_KEY env variable so we don't have to pass it every time in the commandline:
```console
% export PINECONE_API_KEY=1234-4567-abc
```

The pattern for using the tool is to invoke 'pinecli' and then use a command.  The list of commands appears with --help

```console
% ./pinecli.py --help
Usage: pinecli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  A command line interface for working with Pinecone.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  configure-index-pod-type  Configures the given index to have a pod type.

                            index.
  create-collection         Creates a Pinecone collection from the argument
                            'source_index'

  update                    Updates the index based on the given id passed in.
  upsert                    Extracts text from url arg, vectorizes w/ openai
                            embedding api, and upserts to Pinecone.
  upsert-file               Upserts a file (csv) into the specified index.
  upsert-random             Upserts a vector(s) with random dimensions into
                            the specified vector.
  upsert-webpage            Extracts text from url arg, vectorizes w/ openai
                            embedding api, and upserts to Pinecone.
```

# Examples
Let's try some commands showing two missing features I'd love to have had over the last year: a "head" command and a quick "stats" command:

## Index Stats Including Number of Vectors
``` console
% ./pinecli.py describe-index-stats myindex
Dimensions: 1536
Vectors: 7745
Index_Fullness: 0.0
Namespace data:
        : 7745
```

## Head command to preview vectors
``` console
% ./pinecli.py head kids-facenet
{'matches': [{'id': 'bubba_50.jpg.vec',
              'metadata': {},
              'score': 12.182938,
              'values': [-0.016061664,
                         -0.4495437,
                         -0.034082577,
                         .....
```

Now, let's query some nonsensical data from the index named 'upsertfile'

## Inserting a vector directly 
*Note the double quites around the vector*
```console
% ./pinecli.py query myindex  "[1.2, 1.0, 3.0]" --print-table  --include-meta=True
                      🌲 upsertfile ns=() Index Results                      
┏━━━━━━┳━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃   ID ┃ NS ┃ Values                   ┃                Meta ┃        Score ┃
┡━━━━━━╇━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ vec1 │    │ 0.1,0.2,0.3              │  {'genre': 'drama'} │    0.9640127 │
│ vec2 │    │ 0.2,0.3,0.4              │ {'genre': 'action'} │    0.9552943 │
│  abc │    │ 0.23223,-1.333,0.2222222 │      {'foo': 'bar'} │ -0.083585836 │
│  ghi │    │ 0.23223,-1.333,0.2222222 │      {'bar': 'baz'} │ -0.083585836 │
└──────┴────┴──────────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

You can of course not output the pretty table by removing ```--print-table```:
```console
% ./pinecli.py query myindex "[1.2, 1.0, 3.0]" --include-meta=True
{'matches': [{'id': 'vec1',
              'metadata': {'genre': 'drama'},
              'score': 0.9640127,
              'values': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]},
              ...
```

## Upsert Vectors in Command Line Manually
Following the Pinecone vector format of the tuple formatted as:
```python
('vectorid', [vecdim1, vecdim2, vecdim3], {'metakey':'metaval'})
```
You can pass this in as a comma separated list of vectors on the command line:
```console
./pinecli.py upsert myindex "[('vec1', [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], {'genre': 'drama'}), ('vec2', [0.2, 0.3, 0.4], {'foo': 'bar'}),]"
```

## Upsert CSV file
Upserting a csv file is trivial.  Simply create your csv file with any headings you have, but there must be at least a labeled id column and a labeled vector column for the vectors.  Here's an example of a CSV file that works great w/ pinecone-cli:
```console
index,my_id_column,my_vectors_column,Metadata
1,abc,"[0.23223, -1.333, 0.2222222]",{'foo':'bar'}
2,ghi,"[0.23223, -1.333, 0.2222222]",{'bar':'baz'}
```
The name of those columns in the header row can be arbitrary or you can name then "id", "vectors" and "metadata" which is our default assumption.  If you have custom column names and don't want to change them, just pass in the ```--colmap``` argument which takes in a python dictionary mapping "id" and "vectors" to the naming you have in your csv.  For example:
```"{"id":"my_id_column", "vectors":"my_vectors_column"}```

Note that as in other CSV file for Dataframes, we need an index column as in the example above.
Here's an example using the CSV headers and format above with the correct colmap argument:
```console
% ./pinecli.py upsert-file  embeddings.csv myindex "{'id':'my_id_column', 'vectors':'my_vectors_column'}"
```

### More on CSV Formatting
For now you will need to manually provide an index column (we are using dataframes under the hood.)


## Upserting Vector Embeddings of Webpage Text!
pinecone-cli was built to make using Pinecone extremely easy and fast.  We have integrated [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) (others coming) - using its [embedding APIs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) to fetch embeddings.  We then upload them into your index for you, making uploading embeddings of an entire website's text - trivial.
```console
% ./pinecli.py upsert-webpage https://menlovc.com lpfactset  --openaiapikey=12345-9876-abcdef

## Upsert Random Vectors
One of the more useful things we can do with pinecone-cli is insert random vectors, primarily for testing.  Often we will create our index and the length of the vector will be 1,536 dimensions, for example.  Instead of writing a bunch of code to go suddenly create those vectors somehow, we can use pinecone-cli to start generating vectors and upserting them:
```console
% ./pinecli.py upsert-random  upsertfile  --num_vector_dims=1536 --num_vectors=10 --debug                                                                                                                                      
upserted_count: 10
1it [00:00,  4.36it/s]  
```
The example above inserts 10 vectors that each have 1,536 random vectors in them. Note that the ```id``` for each vector is simply ```f'id-{i}'``` where is is the ith row (vector) inserted.

## Query Vectors
Querying can be done in two ways on the cmdline - pass in an actual vector string literal, or ask Pinecone to query randomly (maybe you want to just look at them or look at a TSNE).  In the example below, the last argument (required) is either the string 'random' or an actual vector such as '[0.0, 1.0, 3.14569]'.  Let's try random:
```console
% ./pinecli.py query myindex random
```

You can also plot a TSNE plot to view clustering of your vectors by using the ```-show-tsne=True``` flag.  Note that this will pop up the plt plot by default. 

```console
% ./pinecli.py query lpfactset random --show-tsne=True --perplexity=15 --topk=1000
```

## Fetching Vectors:
Fetching is simple - just pass in the vector id(s) of the vectors you're looking for as a comma separated list:
```console
% ./pinecli.py fetch myindex --vector_ids="05b4509ee655aacb10bfbb6ba212c65c,c626975ec096b9108f158a56a59b2fd6"

{'namespace': '',
 'vectors': {'05b4509ee655aacb10bfbb6ba212c65c': {'id': '05b4509ee655aacb10bfbb6ba212c65c',
                                                  'metadata': {'content': 'Chime '
                                                                          'Scholar '
                                                                          'spotlight: '
```
